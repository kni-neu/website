You only need to do questions 1 and 2 in homework five if you've downloaded the homework before October 22. If you've downloaded the homework as of 10/22, then complete the entirety of the homework, following the instructions in [the homework](/homework-5). These are Bayes Rules and the Conditional Probability proof. These questions are the most relevant to the midterm exam.

### Midterm Preparation

The midterm exam will consist of ten questions, and students will have the entire three hours and twenty minutes to complete it. All formulas will be provided; no cheatsheets, computers, or electronic devices are allowed. (You can bring your phones, just donâ€™t use them during the exam.) We will provide scratch paper. The breakdown of these questions are:

* Map Reduce Questions (30%)
* Principle Component Analysis (10%)
* Maximum Likelihood Questions (10%)
* Unsupervised Machine Learning Questions (10%)
* Multi-Part Frequent Itemsets and Association Rules Questions (20%)
* Fresh Content Bayesian Rules Questions (20%)

The midterm is close book without any notes. I will provide some information on the board so that memorization of formulas is unnecessary. Among the information that I anticipate as helpful, here are some that might help:

* Commonly used map-reduce functions: `map`, `flatMap`, `reduceByKey`, and `filter`
* Some helpful derivatives and math properties: `log`, `exponent`, `product`
* Probabilistic rules: conditional probability, total probability, and Bayes rule

I would suggest that you practice these so that you needn't look up at the board so frequently.
