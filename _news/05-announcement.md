Last semester, the teaching assistant recorded a recitation for this week, and you can watch it below. If you cannot see the text, you can [click on this link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFCzsmKWsRs) or click on the video to open the original video on YouTube.

For reference, please review the [questions that he used in his Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/12jFOfj7Pf0Farum10IWXEfhKSLXPhRed).
 
The questions in his Colab refer to the [same dataset](https://course.ccs.neu.edu/cs6220/fall2023/homework-3/) used in [assignment 3](../../homework-3). The last two questions are chanllenging, but hopefully it will make you farmiliar with map reduce. I am also going record a short video next week talking about the quesitons. Besides, you can drop by my OH if you have any questions.
