### Additional Midterm Preparation

[Midterm preparation slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/18sWEmfkzLzCeDKigFUx8WmBzwuYw19jG) were linked in [last week's (10/28) lecture](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1RU9sXbyF-lnqOpzdJCLyMPtXzf5SsvEfoaiHWUoSuws). 

In class, there was a request to solve the PySpark k-Means problem. I would encourage you **to not look at the following code**, but in case you are absolutely blocked and cannot move forward, please peruse: [PySpark - Map/Reduce k-Means](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/message/19:0wiew4w59eyTcq-GiBIzqyiNW4QBMyUGj1CfgirpdQw1@thread.tacv2/1708704491771?tenantId=a8eec281-aaa3-4dae-ac9b-9a398b9215e7&groupId=6598288e-4482-4e4f-bbd9-7eda41a84758&parentMessageId=1708704491771&teamName=CS6220%20Data%20Mining%20Techniques%20-%20Spring%202024&channelName=General&createdTime=1708704491771).
