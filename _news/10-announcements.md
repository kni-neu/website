Projects will be reviewed on or before December 6 (extra credit) and December 9 (normal credit). It is important to have them ready *before* those dates so that I can ask questions throughout the day and advise you if your endpoint is not active. Excited to see what you come up with! 

Since we are submitting online asynchronously, *there will be no class next week*. I will evaluate your projects on the plane or after I land.

* Fill out the [slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1VO-SAmfm3smmDhVn6AkyK-SZTDURDILz9xCFx_0OiAA) with the:
  * Name(s) of each contributor
  * Topic of your problem (link to your instructions later in the deck)
  * IP address of your endpoint

The lecture slides refer to [this github link](https://github.com/kni-neu/streamlit_cloudrun/tree/main), which provides some good examples on how to create your endpoint.

### End-point grading procedure

This year, we have elected to submit the project _outside_ of the class hours. For this reason, I'll be taking a flight early out on December 9, so please do the following:

* Submit your project through [gradescope](http://gradescope.com)
* Add your IP Address to the deck **before** December 9, 2024, beginning of day
* I'll review the instructions and try out some edge cases throughout the day
* Keep the IP Address live until **after** December 10, 2024, end of day

If I am having trouble or questions, I will e-mail you / Teams message you. 

### Formal project submission

Submit your deliverables via [Gradescope](http://gradescope.com). There you will need to enter

* Your repository link
* Project PDF report (template below)
* IP address for your endpoint

Feel free to use the following template.
