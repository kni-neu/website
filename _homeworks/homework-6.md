In this homework, we'll be mining reviews in Amazon's buyer review dataset, and you retrieve them [here](https://course.ccs.neu.edu/cs6220/fall2023/homework-5/). Review the homework in this [pdf file]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/pdf/assignment-6.pdf). Remember that reading resources can be found in the [syllabus]({{ site.baseurl }}/syllabus).

#### data and starter kit
-----

We will be working with text, and you will need [the data](https://course.ccs.neu.edu/cs6220/fall2023/homework-5), and the homework is easiest done with [this Google Colab starter kit](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1cPJ5eDwVU_F7H3XDRG1Y7Mfd12kwa7Iw). Also, there is a utility function tucked away in a Python file called [`cs6220hw5.py`](https://course.ccs.neu.edu/cs6220/fall2023/homework-5/cs6220hw5.py), which you can leverage to preprocess the data.
