Here are the starter kits and materials that you might find useful.

* [Here are some mathematical properties](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1zy2veJEjDT-0acPbGsrEC93EP0MOZIx54jL-gA7wPqE) that will help you in derivations.

* Document templates can be either [Overleaf TeX File](https://www.overleaf.com/read/zfwcfsbbgtxj) or [DOCX File](https://docs.google.com/
document/d/1qXipr5Ko2Xpf71GbLzEZXa9khB5w4O2B/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=117230435864186314036&rtpof=true&sd=true). When you've compiled/finished writing, **download the PDF** from Overleaf/Google and upload it to the submission link. 

* As derived in class, there are some mathematical properties that are useful in deriving the gradients. Please take advantage of them [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1zy2veJEjDT-0acPbGsrEC93EP0MOZIx54jL-gA7wPqE).

* To help you get started, you may find that this [Colaboratory Link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1s3_CEVGqApVVMhjhmsnPzllvtYNfiXiA) is useful. In order to submit, you'll need to Download the file as a `*.ipynb` file (Under **
File** &rarr; **Download** &rarr; **Download .ipynb**.)

#### submission instructions

Submit your homework on [Gradescope, Assignment 4](https://www.gradescope.com/). You will need to upload a PDF and your Python code (either as a notebook or as a Python file.)
