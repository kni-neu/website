#### data and starter kit
-----

This week, we'll be [fine-tuning Llama2](https://towardsdatascience.com/fine-tune-your-own-llama-2-model-in-a-colab-notebook-df9823a04a32) in [this notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1PEQyJO1-f6j0S_XJ8DV50NkpzasXkrzd). You will need [the data](https://course.ccs.neu.edu/cs6220/fall2023/homework-7/). If you are using Colabs (not a requirement), you would need a Google account.

Here are the starter kits that you might find useful.

* [Here are some mathematical properties](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1zy2veJEjDT-0acPbGsrEC93EP0MOZIx54jL-gA7wPqE) that will help you in derivations.

* Document templates can be either [Overleaf TeX File](https://www.overleaf.com/read/zfwcfsbbgtxj) or [DOCX File](https://docs.google.com/
document/d/1qXipr5Ko2Xpf71GbLzEZXa9khB5w4O2B/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=117230435864186314036&rtpof=true&sd=true). When you've compiled/finishe
d writing, **download the PDF** from Overleaf/Google and upload it to the submission link. 

* To help you get started, you may find that this [Colaboratory Link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1dAqxrOEqrvlqhCJ2jwKX4UrDlNNACWC7?usp=sharing) is useful. In order to submit, you'll need to Download the file as a `*.ipynb` file (Under **File** &rarr; **Download** &rarr; **Download .ipynb**.)


#### submission instructions

Commit your `*.py` or `*.ipynb` (either is fine as long as they are commented appropriately), `output.txt`, and `assignment2.pdf` to that 
repository and provide the URL via [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/583114).
