You will need [the data](https://course.ccs.neu.edu/cs6220/fall2024/homework-1/), which has data for both the review portion and netflix data for the exploration portion.

Here are the starter kits that you might find useful.

* Document templates can be either [LaTeX File](https://www.overleaf.com/read/gbwryydmdjhv) or [DOCX File](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Q8fpJo-gF_L0_TwUdw5E7x7faOAStK4n). When you've compiled/finished writing, **download the PDF** from Overleaf/Google and upload it to the submission link.

* You may find [Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1sg2CqHhX707YT3IcvCub4PUbCsaOZ6C2) useful, which you can subsequently download the file as a `*.ipynb` file (Under **File** &rarr; **Download** &rarr; **Download .ipynb**.) In Colab, you can download the data with 

  ```
  !wget https://course.ccs.neu.edu/cs6220/fall2023/homework-1/netflix-data/movie_titles.csv
  !wget https://course.ccs.neu.edu/cs6220/fall2023/homework-1/netflix-data/combined_data_1.txt
  !wget https://course.ccs.neu.edu/cs6220/fall2023/homework-1/netflix-data/combined_data_2.txt
  !wget https://course.ccs.neu.edu/cs6220/fall2023/homework-1/netflix-data/combined_data_3.txt
  !wget https://course.ccs.neu.edu/cs6220/fall2023/homework-1/netflix-data/combined_data_4.txt
  ```

* You can use any repository system to submit code as long as there is an online link to it. The standard way is to use Github, but you can have a sharepoint folder too as long as it's clear what each individual file is.

-----
#### submission instructions
-----

Commit all your code and materials to your repository, and submit via [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/690988). There, you will upload your PDF and code.

#### project checkpoint
-----

Each week, there will be a checkpoint for you project so that you are on track to turn in the project at the end of the semester. In your homework this week, you will

* start surveying the available data (preferably *outside* of Kaggle). List three interesting datasets here.
* start introducing yourself to your classmates and seeing whether or not you'd like to form a team. List the names of three classmates that you've met.
